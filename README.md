# 🍚 Taskotto

**The Linux task manager, served your way.**

A customizable process manager and system monitor written in **Rust**. Runs alone or alongside [RiceBowl](https://github.com/CopyPasteUser/Ricebowl) on **X11 and Wayland**.

> **Status:** `1.0.0-rc.1` — the scoped feature set is implemented and automated tests pass. **Not a certified stable 1.0 yet:** real X11/Wayland GUI and resource-use acceptance remain. See [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and [QA checklist](QA.md).

## What works

- **Processes:** searchable live list, CPU/RAM/PID/name sort, tree, user filter and detailed stats.
- **Safe actions:** terminate, force kill, pause and resume with confirmation and PID-reuse protection via Linux `pidfd`.
- **Performance:** CPU/core load, RAM/swap, network and disk I/O rates, rolling graphs.
- **Riceable:** 8 profiles, compact/comfortable density, custom accent and persistent TOML preferences.
- **Independent:** no root service, no resident daemon, no RiceBowl or desktop-shell dependency.
- **Headless:** `--snapshot --json` is available without a graphical session.

## Build and run

Requires Linux, Rust 1.88+ and a working X11 or Wayland session with OpenGL support.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CopyPasteUser/Taskotto.git
cd Taskotto
cargo run --release
```

The first compilation may take a while because of the GUI toolkit. Later starts do not recompile.

### Install for your user

```bash
cargo install --path . --locked
taskotto --install-desktop
```

The installer creates a user-local application entry with the executable's absolute path, so the menu does not depend on your graphical session's `PATH`. Then launch **Taskotto** from the applications menu.

## Controls

| Action | Shortcut / command |
| --- | --- |
| Search processes | `Ctrl+F` |
| Refresh immediately | `F5` |
| Clear search / dismiss confirmation | `Esc` |
| Show system snapshot | `taskotto --snapshot` |
| JSON snapshot | `taskotto --snapshot --json` |
| Choose a rice | `taskotto --theme xp-luna` |
| Reduce polling | `taskotto --refresh-ms 5000` |

Select a process to see **Details** and signal actions. A confirmation dialog appears before any signal. Taskotto uses only the permissions of the current user and refuses signals to PID 1 and itself.

### RiceBowl integration

RiceBowl can pass its current rice when launching Taskotto:

```bash
RICEBOWL_RICE=windows7 taskotto
```

The `--theme` flag overrides this environment variable. Preferences are stored at `~/.config/taskotto/config.toml` or the XDG config location. No external service or theme assets are needed.

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-targets
cargo build --locked --release
```

- [Roadmap to 1.0](ROADMAP.md) — milestones, acceptance gates and deferred enhancements.
- [Hardware QA checklist](QA.md) — X11/Wayland, process safety and measured resource use.
- [Release candidate notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md) — implemented scope, verified checks and known limitations.
- [RiceField](https://github.com/CopyPasteUser/Ricefield) — matching standalone Rust file manager.

**Limitations:** Linux only. The first sample has no historical CPU/I/O baseline. Disk rates are block-device totals, and network rates sum interfaces excluding loopback (virtual interfaces can double-count traffic). Kernel 5.3+ is required for safe process signals; monitoring works on older kernels. GPU monitoring and container-specific views are future extensions.
